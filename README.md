# Drive Resource for Moodle

**Drive Resource** is a protected Moodle activity for publishing Google Drive and Moodle-private learning resources without exposing upstream file URLs in plugin-owned PDF and video viewers.

The internal Moodle component remains `mod_videoplayer` for upgrade, capability, database, privacy and backup compatibility. The commercial product name is **Drive Resource**.

## Supported platform

| Component | Supported |
|---|---|
| Moodle | 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2 |
| Minimum Moodle build | `2025041400` |
| PHP | 8.2 and 8.3 |
| Databases validated by CI | MariaDB 10.11 and PostgreSQL 15 |
| Browser libraries | Bundled locally; no runtime CDN |

`version.php` declares `$plugin->supported = [500, 502]`. Moodle 4.x is outside the current release contract.

## Main capabilities

- Protected Google Drive video, PDF, image, document, spreadsheet and presentation delivery.
- Local protected PDFs stored with Moodle File API.
- Moodle-owned `protected.php` endpoint with login, course-module, context and capability checks.
- Memory-bounded streaming with `HEAD`, `Range`, `If-Range`, `206 Partial Content` and `416` support.
- Local PDF.js rendering with zoom, fit, previous/next navigation, fullscreen and mobile swipe navigation.
- Local Plyr enhancement over native HTML5 video with iPhone/iPad inline playback and seeking.
- Fast-first-byte PDF proxying with deduplicated asynchronous cache warming.
- Progress, completion, Moodle events, Privacy API and Backup/Restore integration.
- Activity-only CSS isolation that does not modify themes or third-party course formats.

## Requirements

- Moodle 5.0 or newer within the declared supported range.
- PHP 8.2+ with the extensions required by Moodle 5.0, including cURL, DOM, Fileinfo, GD, Intl, Mbstring, OpenSSL, SimpleXML, Sodium, XML and ZIP.
- HTTPS in production.
- Moodle cron running frequently.
- Writable `$CFG->localcachedir`.

## Installation

Copy the complete plugin directory to:

```text
mod/videoplayer
```

Required viewer assets include:

```text
styles_activity.css
styles_pdf_mobile.css
amd/build/pdfjsloader.min.js
amd/build/pdfviewer.min.js
thirdpartylibs/pdfjs/pdf.min.mjs
thirdpartylibs/pdfjs/pdf.worker.min.mjs
thirdpartylibs/plyr/plyr.css
thirdpartylibs/plyr/plyr.min.js
```

Run from the Moodle root:

```bash
php admin/cli/upgrade.php --non-interactive
php admin/cli/purge_caches.php
```

After deployment, reset PHP OPcache and invalidate Cloudflare, NGINX or other reverse-proxy caches for `/mod/videoplayer/`.

## Release 1.1.27-beta

Release `1.1.27-beta` restores one deterministic production PDF path:

```text
protected.php
↓
authenticated byte-range delivery
↓
local PDF.js module and worker
↓
PDF.js canvas viewer
↓
learner
```

Legacy `standard`, `ebook` and `book` database values are converted to `pdfjs` during upgrade and normalised again at runtime. The PageFlip and legacy book renderers are removed from the learner path, preventing JavaScript library source from appearing as visible document content on mobile devices.

Release `1.1.25-beta` introduced the native local `<script type="module">` loader required for modern PDF.js ES-module builds. The loader validates the PDF.js API before assigning the bundled worker URL.

## Protected delivery architecture

```text
Google Drive link / Moodle private PDF
↓
Drive Resource activity
↓
protected.php
↓
require_login + course module + context_module + capability
↓
protected_stream OR http_range_proxy
↓
local PDF.js / HTML5 video viewer
↓
learner
```

The browser receives Moodle URLs for protected PDF and video delivery. Raw Google Drive file IDs, direct download URLs and preview URLs remain server-side.

## PDF delivery

Cold Google Drive PDFs use this flow:

```text
PDF.js range request
↓
Moodle authorisation
↓
queue deduplicated precache task
↓
proxy requested bytes immediately
↓
cron warms the complete local cache
↓
later requests use the protected cache
```

The original PDF bytes are preserved. Drive Resource does not recompress, rasterise or transcode documents.

Cache path:

```text
$CFG->localcachedir/mod_videoplayer/pdf/
```

### PDF.js loading boundary

PDF.js and its worker are bundled locally as ES modules. The AMD viewer does not import `.mjs` through RequireJS. Instead, `mod_videoplayer/pdfjsloader` creates one same-origin module script, validates `window.pdfjsLib`, assigns the local worker and caches the loading promise.

```text
mod_videoplayer/pdfviewer
↓
mod_videoplayer/pdfjsloader
↓
<script type="module" src="pdf.min.mjs">
↓
window.pdfjsLib validation
↓
pdf.worker.min.mjs
```

A controlled viewer error is shown when the local module cannot initialise.

### PDF viewer

Every PDF uses the standard local PDF.js canvas viewer. It provides:

- previous and next page;
- page number and total pages;
- zoom in and out;
- fit to screen;
- fullscreen;
- responsive sizing;
- swipe navigation on mobile;
- saved last page, active time and completion progress.

The activity form no longer exposes alternative PDF renderers.

## Video delivery

Protected video uses an HTML5 `<video>` element and local Plyr enhancement. Native controls remain the fallback. The player uses metadata preload, keeps `playsinline`/`webkit-playsinline`, and relies on correct byte-range responses for Safari/iOS seeking.

## CSS isolation

Moodle compiles a module's root `styles.css` into the global theme bundle. Drive Resource intentionally keeps it free of viewer presentation.

Viewer presentation is loaded only from activity-scoped styles such as `styles_activity.css` and `styles_pdf_mobile.css`. Drive Resource does not patch Moodle themes or third-party course formats.

## Automated compatibility validation

GitHub Actions runs `.github/workflows/moodle-50-ci.yml` against:

- Moodle `MOODLE_500_STABLE`;
- PHP 8.2 and 8.3;
- MariaDB 10.11 and PostgreSQL 15.

The workflow performs PHP lint, Moodle coding style, PHPDoc validation, plugin validation, upgrade-savepoint checks, Mustache validation, AMD/JavaScript validation, the PDF.js native-ESM loader contract, the stable PDF.js production-path contract and PHPUnit tests.

## Development

AMD sources are under `amd/src/` and production bundles under `amd/build/`.

```bash
npx grunt amd
```

Any AMD source change must include its rebuilt production bundle. The generated `pdfjsloader.min.js` must create a native module script and must not contain Moodle's dynamic-import transformer.
