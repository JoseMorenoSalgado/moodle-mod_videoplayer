# Drive Resource architecture

Drive Resource is a Moodle activity module. Its stable internal component is `mod_videoplayer`; its commercial product name is **Drive Resource**.

## Compatibility boundary

- Moodle 5.0–5.2.
- Minimum Moodle build `2025041400`.
- PHP 8.2 and 8.3.
- MariaDB 10.11 and PostgreSQL 15 in CI.

The implementation uses APIs available on `MOODLE_500_STABLE`. A newer Moodle-only API must not enter the shared release branch while Moodle 5.0 remains supported.

## Target flow

```text
Google Drive link or Moodle private PDF
↓
Drive Resource activity
↓
view.php
↓
protected.php
↓
require_login + course module + context_module + capability
↓
protected_stream OR http_range_proxy
↓
local PDF.js / HTML5 video / protected resource output
↓
progress + completion + Moodle events
↓
learner
```

Plugin-owned PDF and video viewers must not receive raw Google Drive file IDs, direct download URLs or Google preview URLs.

## Main responsibilities

### `view.php`

- Resolves the course module, course and activity instance.
- Enforces login and `mod/videoplayer:view`.
- Builds only Moodle-owned protected URLs.
- Selects the viewer by detected resource type.
- Loads `mod_videoplayer/pdfviewer` for every PDF.
- Loads local Plyr enhancement for video.
- Renders the appropriate Mustache template.

### `protected.php`

- Repeats the complete access-control boundary for every byte request.
- Closes the Moodle session write lock before long streaming operations.
- Delegates local/cache delivery to `protected_stream`.
- Delegates upstream range proxying to `http_range_proxy`.
- Never becomes a generic arbitrary-URL proxy.

### `classes/local/protected_stream.php`

Handles Moodle-private files and trusted cache files, including:

- PDF signature validation;
- `HEAD` requests;
- one validated byte range;
- `200`, `206` and `416` responses;
- `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `Content-Range` and `Accept-Ranges`;
- cache freshness and lifecycle;
- bounded streaming without loading the complete resource into PHP memory.

### `classes/local/http_range_proxy.php`

Handles Google Drive upstream delivery, including:

- validated Google-owned upstream destinations;
- one browser range forwarded upstream;
- allowlisted response metadata;
- rejection of HTML/login/error bodies presented as media;
- chunked cURL output;
- no complete-file PHP buffering.

## Stable PDF rendering boundary

Release `1.1.27-beta` defines one production PDF renderer:

```text
protected PDF URL
↓
mod_videoplayer/pdfviewer
↓
mod_videoplayer/pdfjsloader
↓
<script type="module" src="thirdpartylibs/pdfjs/pdf.min.mjs">
↓
validate window.pdfjsLib
↓
configure thirdpartylibs/pdfjs/pdf.worker.min.mjs
↓
render the requested page to canvas
```

The activity form stores `displaymode = pdfjs`. Runtime normalisation and the database upgrade convert historical `standard`, `ebook` and `book` values to `pdfjs`.

StPageFlip and the legacy book renderer are not part of the learner execution path. This prevents a JavaScript library asset from being mistaken for document content and removes inconsistent renderer selection across mobile and desktop browsers.

## PDF.js ES-module loading

PDF.js is bundled as an ES module. Moodle AMD source must not call `import(PDFJS_URL)` directly because the build can transform that expression into a RequireJS request, while `.mjs` is not an AMD module.

`mod_videoplayer/pdfjsloader` owns the loading contract:

- same-origin constant paths only;
- one cached loading promise per page;
- one local `<script type="module">` element;
- validation of `getDocument` and `GlobalWorkerOptions`;
- assignment of the bundled worker path only;
- controlled rejection when the module cannot initialise;
- no CDN, `eval`, arbitrary URL or unsafe runtime code generation.

## PDF fast-first-byte flow

```text
PDF.js byte-range request
↓
Moodle authorisation
↓
fresh protected cache?
├─ yes → serve requested local range
└─ no  → queue deduplicated precache task
          ↓
          proxy the requested range immediately
          ↓
          cron warms the complete verified PDF cache
```

Drive Resource preserves the original PDF bytes. It does not recompress, rasterise or transcode the document.

## PDF viewer state

`amd/src/pdfviewer.js` maintains:

- current page and total pages;
- zoom and fit-to-screen state;
- fullscreen state;
- touch-swipe navigation;
- last page reached;
- active time;
- completion percentage;
- optional points/rewards.

Only the active page is rendered. Adjacent pages may be prefetched through PDF.js without eagerly creating canvases for the complete document.

## Video viewer

`amd/src/plyr.js` progressively enhances a native HTML5 `<video>` element. Native controls remain the fallback. The protected response determines the media MIME type, and correct range metadata enables Safari/iOS seeking.

## CSS isolation

Moodle compiles root module CSS globally. Drive Resource keeps `styles.css` free of presentation rules.

Activity presentation is loaded explicitly from viewer-scoped files such as:

```text
styles_activity.css
styles_pdf_mobile.css
styles_pdf_overlay.css
styles_visual_refinements.css
```

Selectors, overlays and fullscreen states must remain scoped beneath Drive Resource roots. Themes and third-party course formats must never be modified to compensate for a plugin-local defect.

## Progress and completion

Viewer AMD modules call `mod_videoplayer_save_progress`. The external function revalidates context and capability before delegating to progress and optional reward services.

Persisted state includes:

- active time;
- progress value;
- completion percentage;
- last PDF page;
- total PDF pages;
- completion state;
- optional points and rewards.

## Events

- `course_module_viewed`
- `progress_updated`
- `resource_completed`
- `reward_awarded`

## Backup, restore and privacy

Backup and Restore include activity configuration, Moodle-local PDF files and optional user progress/reward data. The Privacy API declares, exports and deletes the personal data stored by progress and reward tables.

## Validation architecture

`.github/workflows/moodle-50-ci.yml` is the executable compatibility gate. It runs lint, Moodle Coding Style, PHPDoc, plugin validation, XMLDB savepoint validation, Mustache, AMD/JavaScript and PHPUnit on Moodle 5.0 across the supported PHP/database matrix.

The workflow also enforces:

- the native local PDF.js ES-module loader contract;
- the PDF.js-only learner production path;
- absence of PageFlip and legacy book viewer references from `view.php`;
- `pdfjs` as the XMLDB display-mode default.

## Mobile media reliability in 1.1.28-beta

The protected stream boundary now treats browser Range requests as strict contracts. A seek request is emitted to the learner only when Google returns a valid `206` response with `Content-Range`; an upstream `200` is discarded and retried with an explicit Range header. Browser-facing validators are owned by Moodle so redirect-specific Google ETags cannot downgrade later seeks to complete responses. PDF rendering remains local PDF.js and starts from page 1.

## PDF fullscreen stage (1.1.29-beta)

The PDF template separates three layers: a fixed control overlay, a scrollable viewport and a `mod-videoplayer-pdfjs-canvas-stage` containing the canvas and watermark. Auto margins centre a page only while positive free space exists. When zoom creates overflow, those margins collapse to zero, preserving a reachable top-left scroll origin without JavaScript layout heuristics.
