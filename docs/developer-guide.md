# Drive Resource developer guide

## Component identity

The Moodle component remains `mod_videoplayer`. Do not rename it: installed sites depend on this identifier for upgrades, capabilities, database tables, files, Privacy API and Backup/Restore mappings.

## Supported development target

- Moodle 5.0–5.2.
- Baseline branch `MOODLE_500_STABLE`.
- Minimum Moodle version `2025041400`.
- PHP 8.2 and 8.3.
- CI databases MariaDB 10.11 and PostgreSQL 15.

Moodle 4.x compatibility must not be claimed without a separate maintained branch and complete CI matrix.

## Engineering rules

- Moodle Coding Style takes precedence.
- Use Moodle APIs rather than direct filesystem or database shortcuts.
- Keep public endpoints thin and delegate business logic.
- Bundle browser libraries locally; runtime CDN dependencies are prohibited.
- Keep streaming memory-bounded.
- Keep functions cohesive and small.
- Update AMD source and compiled production bundles together.
- Review File API, Privacy API, Backup/Restore, Events and Completion for each data-model change.
- Do not patch themes or course-format plugins to fix Drive Resource defects.

styles.css                intentionally presentation-free global stylesheet
styles_activity.css       activity-only base presentation
styles_pdf_mobile.css     mobile PDF presentation
```

## Protected delivery contract

`protected.php` must execute this order:

```text
required activity id
→ course module
→ course
→ activity instance
→ require_login
→ context_module
→ require_capability
→ close session write lock
→ protected_stream or http_range_proxy
```

Never return raw Google Drive IDs, direct download URLs, preview URLs or upstream error bodies.

`protected_stream` owns Moodle-private/cache files. `http_range_proxy` owns upstream HTTP streaming. Do not send both a manually constructed `Range` header and `CURLOPT_RANGE` for the same upstream request.

## PDF renderer contract

Every production PDF must use:

```text
mod_videoplayer/pdfviewer
```

`view.php` must not load:

```text
mod_videoplayer/ebookviewer
mod_videoplayer/bookviewer
thirdpartylibs/pageflip/*
```

`videoplayer_get_safe_pdf_displaymode()` is the single runtime normalisation point. It currently returns only `pdfjs`. Historical values such as `standard`, `ebook` and `book` must remain safely migratable to `pdfjs`.

Do not reintroduce an animated page-turn renderer directly into the learner path. A future experimental renderer would require all of the following before consideration:

- an explicit disabled-by-default feature flag;
- complete isolation from the stable PDF.js path;
- deterministic PDF.js fallback;
- physical iPhone and Android regression testing;
- range, memory and accessibility validation;
- CI coverage proving that JavaScript asset URLs cannot become document URLs;
- product approval before enabling it on existing activities.

## PDF.js module loading

PDF.js is shipped locally as ES modules:

```text
thirdpartylibs/pdfjs/pdf.min.mjs
thirdpartylibs/pdfjs/pdf.worker.min.mjs
```

Do not call `import(PDFJS_URL)` directly from AMD source. Moodle's Babel build can transform dynamic imports into RequireJS requests, but `.mjs` is not an AMD module.

All protected PDF rendering must depend on:

```text
mod_videoplayer/pdfjsloader
```

The loader must:

- create a same-origin `<script type="module">` for `pdf.min.mjs`;
- validate `window.pdfjsLib.getDocument` and `GlobalWorkerOptions`;
- configure only the bundled `pdf.worker.min.mjs`;
- cache one loading promise per page;
- remove/recover from a failed module element before retrying;
- reject through a controlled Promise error;
- never accept URLs from request data or activity configuration;
- never use CDN, `eval`, arbitrary imports or unsafe runtime code generation.

After changing `amd/src/pdfjsloader.js`, rebuild the production bundle with Moodle Grunt:

```bash
npx grunt amd --root=mod/videoplayer
```

The generated `amd/build/pdfjsloader.min.js` must contain native module-script creation and must not contain `_systemImportTransformerGlobalIdentifier`.

## PDF viewer behavior

`amd/src/pdfviewer.js` must preserve:

- idempotent initialization;
- previous and next page controls;
- current and total page display;
- zoom boundaries and fit-to-screen;
- fullscreen with a controlled CSS fallback;
- touch-swipe navigation without blocking vertical scrolling;
- responsive rendering on resize/orientation change;
- bounded device-pixel-ratio scaling;
- progress persistence;
- adjacent-page prefetch only;
- controlled error UI.

Do not render all pages into canvases. Render the active page and allow PDF.js to fetch only what is needed through the protected range endpoint.

## PDF performance

- Keep the first visible page on the critical path.
- Use `rangeChunkSize` suitable for progressive PDF loading.
- Prefetch only adjacent pages.
- Preserve original PDF bytes.
- Proxy cold ranges immediately.
- Warm verified complete PDFs asynchronously through a deduplicated ad-hoc task.
- Do not buffer complete PDFs in PHP memory.
- Bound canvas backing dimensions through a device-pixel-ratio ceiling.
- Re-render only after meaningful resize, zoom or fullscreen changes.

## Video development

- Keep native HTML5 controls as fallback.
- Preserve `playsinline` and `webkit-playsinline`.
- Use metadata preload unless profiling demonstrates a better safe option.
- Preserve valid `206 Partial Content` metadata for Safari/iOS seeking.
- Do not force a MIME type that conflicts with the protected response.
- Avoid loading the complete video into PHP memory.

## CSS isolation

Root `styles.css` is global in Moodle and must not contain viewer presentation.

Viewer rules must be loaded explicitly from activity-scoped CSS and use `mod-videoplayer` or `drive-resource` prefixes. Generic fullscreen, overlay, loading and active-state selectors are prohibited.

## Database upgrades

For schema or persisted-default changes:

1. update `db/install.xml`;
2. add an idempotent `db/upgrade.php` step;
3. migrate existing values safely;
4. handle dependent indexes before changing indexed fields;
5. update Backup/Restore and Privacy API when data shape changes;
6. bump `version.php`;
7. run Moodle savepoint validation.

The `2026080600` upgrade changes `displaymode` to `pdfjs` for all existing records. Do not remove that compatibility step.

## Automated tests

Current contracts include:

- `tests/drive_test.php` for supported URLs, file IDs, resource detection and protected endpoints;
- `tests/http_range_proxy_test.php` for byte-range behavior;
- `tests/moodle50_compatibility_test.php` for platform metadata and required APIs;
- `tests/pdf_displaymode_test.php` for legacy display-mode normalisation and PDF.js-only routing.

The CI workflow must pass:

- PHP lint;
- Moodle Coding Style;
- PHPDoc;
- plugin validation;
- XMLDB upgrade savepoints;
- Mustache validation;
- Grunt/AMD validation;
- PDF.js native-ESM loader contract;
- PDF.js-only production-path contract;
- PHPUnit on the supported matrix.

## Commercial release gate

A release is not approved until CI passes and staging verifies:

- fresh installation and upgrade from the previous release;
- local and Google Drive PDF opening;
- no PageFlip request in the browser network panel;
- no JavaScript source displayed as PDF content;
- PDF.js initialization on physical Android and iPhone browsers;
- previous/next, zoom, fit, fullscreen and swipe navigation;
- correct valid and invalid byte ranges;
- video start, seek and resume on physical iPhone Safari;
- progress and completion persistence;
- Backup/Restore;
- Privacy API export/delete;
- no leaked Google Drive URLs;
- normal operation with standard and third-party course formats;
- no developer-debug warnings or browser console errors.
